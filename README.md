Volatility Framework
====================

Volatility Framework is a research-oriented Python framework for building, evaluating, and comparing volatility forecasting models. It is designed to support systematic experimentation, from raw data ingestion through model development and rigorous performance analysis.

Planned components:
- Data processing pipeline for raw and cleaned datasets
- Model implementations for volatility forecasting
- Evaluation metrics for forecast quality and risk assessment
- Jupyter notebooks for exploratory analysis and experiment reports

Experiments and research workflows are demonstrated primarily through Jupyter notebooks stored in the `notebooks` directory.
